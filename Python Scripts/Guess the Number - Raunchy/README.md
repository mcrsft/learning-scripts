🎮 Game Rules
10 Levels of Increasing Difficulty
Each level increases the max possible number. (Level 1: 1–10, Level 2: 1–20... Level 10: 1–100)

Scoring System

Points = 100 * level - (attempts * 10)

Fewer guesses = more points.

Max out at 1000 points if you're flawless.

Roast Factor

Get witty (and often inappropriate) insults for bad guesses.

The game doesn’t care about your feelings.

Crying is optional.
